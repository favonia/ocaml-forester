\title{notes on duploid theory}

\p{This is an investigation of Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoniâ€™s theory of duploids, working in the setting of univalent foundations. Most of what we do could be done in non-univalent foundations; the purpose of univalence is to sharpen our perspective on the relationship between structure and property in duploid theory.}
